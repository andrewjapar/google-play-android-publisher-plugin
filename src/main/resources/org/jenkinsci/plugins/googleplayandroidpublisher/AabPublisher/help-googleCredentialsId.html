<div>
  Specifies which credential to use in order to connect to Google Play.
  <p/>
  The selected credential must be a "Google Service Account from private
  key" â€” if you have not added one already, refer to the documentation
  on <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-play-android-publisher">this
  plugin's page</a>.
  <p/>
  By choosing the "Parameter expression" option, you can also provide a
  credential at build time, either from an environment variable, or from
  a build parameter, e.g. the Credentials Parameter type.<br/>
  But you can use any type of expression, so long as it expands to the
  name of a "Google Service Account from private key" credential at
  build time.
  <hr/>
  This field supports substituting environment variables in the form
  <tt>${SOME_VARIABLE}</tt> at build time.<br/>
  Note that variables in the form <tt>$SOME_VARIABLE</tt> are
  <em>not</em> accepted by the Credentials Plugin.
