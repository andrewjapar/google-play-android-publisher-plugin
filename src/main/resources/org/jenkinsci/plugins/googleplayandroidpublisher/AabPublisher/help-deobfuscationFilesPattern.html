<div>
  Specifies filenames or patterns matching one or more ProGuard mapping
  files that should be uploaded to Google Play, so that it can automatically
  deobfuscate stacktraces from crash reports.
  <p/>
  You can use wildcards like "<tt>**/build/**/mapping.txt</tt>".<br/>
  See <a href='https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html'>
  the 'includes' attribute of Ant's FileSet</a> for the exact format.<br/>
  Note that multiple entries must be comma-separated.
  <p/>
  The base directory is <a href='ws/'>the build's workspace</a>.
  You can only upload mapping files that are located in your workspace.
  <p/>
  If there are multiple APKs being uploaded, and only one
  <tt>mapping.txt</tt> file is found, then this file will be associated
  with each of the APKs being uploaded. If there are multiple
  <tt>mapping.txt</tt> files, this plugin will make a basic attempt to
  associate each mapping file with the corresponding APK.<br/>
  Otherwise, if the number of mapping files found is not equal to the
  number of APKs being uploaded, the build will fail, as this situation
  is not supported.
  <p/>
  For more information on deobfuscating crash stacktraces, see the
  Google Play documentation:<br/>

  <hr/>
  This field supports substituting environment variables in the form
  <tt>${SOME_VARIABLE}</tt> or <tt>$SOME_VARIABLE</tt> at build time.
